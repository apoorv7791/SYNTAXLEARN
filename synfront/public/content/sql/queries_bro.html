        <h1>Writing SQL Queries - Extracting Data Like a Boss</h1>
        
        <p>
            Yo, what's up data warriors! ðŸ”¥ It's time to level up your SQL game with some serious query skills. This is where the real power of databases comes in - getting exactly the data you want, when you want it. Let's crush this!
        </p>

        <h2>The SELECT Statement - Your Data Extraction Tool</h2>
        
        <p>
            Think of SELECT as your data fishing rod. You cast it into your database ocean and pull out exactly the fish (data) you want.
        </p>
        
        <div class="code-block">
            <pre>
SELECT column1, column2, ... 
FROM table_name;
            </pre>
        </div>
        
        <p>Want ALL the columns? Use the wildcard (*) - but be careful with this power move:</p>
        
        <div class="code-block">
            <pre>
SELECT * 
FROM table_name;
            </pre>
        </div>
        
        <div class="bro-tip">
            <p><strong>Bro Tip:</strong> Using SELECT * in production code is like showing up to the gym and doing random exercises with no plan. Sure, you'll hit some muscles, but it's inefficient and might cause problems later. Be specific about what columns you actually need!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>Real Talk Example:</h3>
            <p>Let's say we have a table of gym members:</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre>
SELECT first_name, last_name, membership_type 
FROM gym_members;
                </pre>
            </div>
            <p>This gives you just the names and membership types - perfect for making a quick member list without all the extra baggage.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>WHERE Clause - Filtering Out the Weak</h2>
        
        <p>
            The WHERE clause is your bouncer - it decides which rows get into your result set club and which ones stay out.
        </p>
        
        <div class="code-block">
            <pre>
SELECT column1, column2, ...

            <p>This query is like saying "Show me the dedicated premium members who actually show up to the gym." Perfect for finding your gym bros!</p>
        </div>

        <h2>ORDER BY - Sorting Your Gains</h2>
        
        <p>
            ORDER BY is how you rank your results - from heaviest lifters to the lightweights, or alphabetically, or whatever order makes sense.
        </p>
        
        <div class="code-block">
            <pre>
SELECT column1, column2, ...

ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...;

        </div>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>ASC</strong> - Ascending order (A to Z, smallest to largest) - this is the default</li>
            <li><strong>DESC</strong> - Descending order (Z to A, largest to smallest) - for when you want the big dogs first</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example:</h3>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre>
SELECT first_name, last_name, max_deadlift 
FROM gym_members
ORDER BY max_deadlift DESC, last_name ASC;
                </pre>
            </div>
            <p>This query ranks everyone by their deadlift PR (heaviest first), and if two people lift the same weight, it sorts them alphabetically by last name. Perfect for your gym's leaderboard!</p>
        </div>

        <h2>LIMIT - Because Ain't Nobody Got Time for All That Data</h2>
        
        <p>
            LIMIT is like telling your spotter "just 5 more reps" - it caps how many results you get back.
        </p>
        
        <div class="code-block">
            <pre>
-- MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite style
SELECT column1, column2, ... 
FROM table_name
LIMIT number;

-- SQL Server style
SELECT TOP(number) column1, column2, ... 
FROM table_name;
            </pre>
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example:</h3>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre>
-- Find the top 5 bench pressers in the gym
SELECT first_name, last_name, max_bench 
FROM gym_members
ORDER BY max_bench DESC
LIMIT 5;
                </pre>
            </div>
            <p>This is perfect for creating a "Top 5" list for your gym's wall of fame!</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Aggregate Functions - Calculating Your Gains</h2>
        
        <p>
            These are like your fitness tracker stats but for your database - they crunch numbers and give you the highlights.

        <table>

            <p>This query gives you a breakdown of stats by membership type - perfect for comparing how your premium members stack up against the basic plan folks!</p>
        </div>

        <h2>GROUP BY - Organizing Your Workout Split</h2>
        
        <p>
            GROUP BY is like organizing members into different workout groups - it clusters similar rows together so you can analyze each group.
        </p>
        
        <div class="code-block">
            <pre>

        </div>

        <h2>HAVING - When Some Groups Just Don't Make the Cut</h2>
        
        <p>
            HAVING is like GROUP BY's bouncer friend - it filters out entire groups that don't meet certain criteria.
        </p>
        
        <div class="code-block">
            <pre>

        </div>

        <div class="bro-tip">
            <p><strong>Bro Science:</strong> WHERE filters individual rows before grouping, while HAVING filters groups after they're formed. It's like the difference between rejecting individual applicants vs. disbanding entire teams.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>JOINs - Combining Your Workout Routines</h2>
        
        <p>
            JOINs are how you combine data from multiple tables - like how you combine different exercises into a complete workout routine.
        </p>
        
        <div class="code-block">
            <pre>

        </div>

        <h2>Subqueries - The Workout Within a Workout</h2>
        
        <p>
            A subquery is a query inside another query - like doing a set of curls in the middle of your squats. It's a power move.
        </p>
        
        <div class="code-block">

        <h2>UNION - Combining Different Workout Plans</h2>
        
        <p>
            UNION combines results from multiple SELECT statements - like how you might combine your chest day and back day when you're short on time.
        </p>
        
        <div class="code-block">
            <pre>
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1
UNION [ALL]
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2;
            </pre>
        </div>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>UNION</strong> - Removes duplicate results (like doing 3 sets of 10 instead of 6 sets of 5)</li>
            <li><strong>UNION ALL</strong> - Keeps all results including duplicates (more volume, bro!)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="example">
            <h3>Example:</h3>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre>
-- Combined list of people who can access the gym
SELECT member_id, first_name, last_name, 'Member' AS type
FROM gym_members
WHERE status = 'Active'
UNION
SELECT staff_id, first_name, last_name, 'Staff' AS type
FROM gym_staff
WHERE employment_status = 'Current';
                </pre>
            </div>
            <p>This query creates a master list of everyone who can access the gym - both members and staff. Perfect for your door security system!</p>

        <h2>SQL Gains - Best Practices for Maximum Results</h2>
        
        <div class="bro-tip">
            <p><strong>Bro Wisdom for SQL Gains:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Don't skip leg day or indexes</strong> - Make sure your frequently queried columns have indexes</li>
                <li><strong>Form matters</strong> - Format your SQL with proper indentation and line breaks</li>
                <li><strong>Don't ego lift with SELECT *</strong> - Only select the columns you actually need</li>
                <li><strong>Use a spotter (parameters)</strong> - Prevent SQL injection by using parameterized queries</li>
                <li><strong>Progressive overload</strong> - Test your queries with increasingly large datasets</li>
                <li><strong>Recovery is important</strong> - Add comments to complex queries so others (including future you) understand them</li>
                <li><strong>Proper nutrition (data types)</strong> - Use the right data types for your columns</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>
            That's it for SQL queries, bro! You've now got the knowledge to extract exactly the data you need from your database. Remember, just like in the gym, consistency and good form are key. Keep practicing these patterns and soon you'll be the SQL beast everyone comes to for help! ðŸ’ª
